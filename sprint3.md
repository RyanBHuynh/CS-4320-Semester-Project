# Sprint 3

The Augur API contains a vast trove of data that is useful for open source developers. Our project centers around extracting relevant information and creating informative, easy to read data visualizations that can be used to provide further insight into specific open source projects. To achieve this, we will pull JSON data from the REST API and then visualize it into relevant formats, such as graphs, pie charts, and bar charts. We output each visualization as an image.
